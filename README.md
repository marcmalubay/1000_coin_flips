This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This project is an experiment based on the probability of a person flipping a coin and landing tails a certain amount of times. Out of 1000 participants, it is likely that one participant will have landed tails 10 times in a row. This simulated experiment showcases the probability of this happening.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

Before running the server however, you must run:
```
npm i
```

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

## Alternatively

Run the command
```
bash dev.sh
```
This runs all the previously mentioned commands.
 

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
