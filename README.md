This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This project is an experiment based on the probability of a person flipping a coin and landing tails a certain amount of times. Out of 1000 participants, it is likely that one participant will have landed tails 10 times in a row. This simulated experiment showcases the probability of this happening.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

Before running the server however, you must run:
```
npm i
```

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
